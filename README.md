Adjust / Scale the size of an Azure Virtual Machine while running or shutdown
=============================================================================

            

This Azure Automation script can automatic adjust the size of the Azure virtual machines while the server is either running or shutdown. This operation could be used to save money when you aren’t using the servers so heavily perhaps during the weekend
 or during the night.

REQUIREMENTS: The script will require some Azure automation assets to be configured before working

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
